# Vote ICT

A service for being an informed voter in the Wichita, KS area.

[voteict.org](https://www.voteict.org)

## Primary Goals

- Receive SMS reminders on important voting dates and information
- Provide access to important information on local elections and voting

## Built With..

- Laravel
- Twilio

## Configuration

In addition to the normal Laravel configuration stuff, this application also
needs to set a few things:

- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` should be your Twilio account
  credentials, get them from your Twilio Dashboard.
- `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` should be the Twilio number that messages are sent out
  from. This must be a number owned by the configured account.
- `TIMEZONE`, defaults to America/Chicago, but should be local to wherever this
  service is used.

## Developing

The recommended way to get the application running locally is to use [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead).

_Note: if you have a global Homestead setup already, these instructions may not
work correctly._

As a quickstart, you can copy `Homestead.yaml.example` to `Homestead.yaml`, and
update the line pointing to where the voteict code is stored locally. For
example, if you installed Homestead into `~/Homestead` and your cloned repo is
in `~/projects/voteict`, you should have a `~/Homestead/Homestead.yaml` file
with a `folders` entry like...

```
folders:
    - map: ~/projects/voteict
      to: /home/vagrant/code
```

Add an `/etc/hosts` entry for...

```
192.168.10.10 homestead.local
```

Within your repo, `cp .env.example .env`.

Then, run `vagrant up`, and then the site should be available at
localhost:8000. Most commands will need to be run inside the vagrant box, so
do `vagrant ssh` first and `cd` into `~/code`.

```
$ composer install
$ artisan key:generate
$ artisan migrate
$ artisan db:seed
$ npm i
```

- To run tests, run `phpunit`.
- To connect to the database, `mysql homestead`.
- To follow the logs, use `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`.

To get Twilio receiving messages locally, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and
point your Twilio number's SMS receive endpoint to the ngrok tunnel URL,
suffixed with the path `/sms/receive`.

To test scheduled messages, you can manually run `artisan schedule:run` from
within the `code` directory inside the vagrant box.
